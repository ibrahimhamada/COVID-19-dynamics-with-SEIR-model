# COVID-19-dynamics-with-SEIR-model
My Project of the Ordinary Differential Equations Course Offered in Spring 2020 @ Zewail City
In this project, we are trying to model the progression of the COVID-19 disease through a set of population using SEIR model which leads to a system of differential equations.
